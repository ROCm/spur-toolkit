# Spur — Ansible Deployment

One playbook (`deploy.yml`) stands up a Spur cluster in every supported shape, driven entirely by inventory. Daemons run as **systemd services** (survive reboot), the Slurm-compatible CLI names are symlinked, and optional **PostgreSQL + spurdbd accounting** is deployed by default.

| Shape | Inventory pattern | Transport |
|---|---|---|
| Single-node | one host in **both** `spur_controllers` and `spur_agents` | local loopback |
| Multi-node — direct LAN | one host in `spur_controllers`, all compute in `spur_agents` | LAN IP, unencrypted |
| Multi-node — WireGuard mesh | as above + `spur_transport=wireguard` (single controller only) | encrypted mesh on `spur0` |
| HA — multi-controller Raft | **≥ 3 hosts** in `spur_controllers` (any number in `spur_agents`); auto-enabled | direct or wireguard |
| HA — separate compute | `spur_controllers` and `spur_agents` are **disjoint** host sets | direct or wireguard |

The playbook is idempotent — re-running it on a healthy cluster re-applies config and restarts daemons.

## End-to-end walkthrough

The full journey from a clean machine to a running cluster is: **clone → build binaries → stage them → write inventory → run the playbook.**

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ROCm/spur.git
cd spur
```

### 2. Build all four binaries

Spur has no published GitHub release yet, so the upstream `install.sh` returns 403. Build the binaries yourself on a machine matching the targets' architecture/libc (the lab targets are Ubuntu 22.04 x86-64), then push them with the playbook (Step 3).

```bash
# Prerequisites (Rust toolchain is pinned in rust-toolchain.toml):
sudo apt install -y protobuf-compiler

# Build the four daemons/CLI in release mode:
cargo build --release -p spur-cli -p spurctld -p spurd -p spurdbd
```

This produces, under `target/release/`:

| Binary | Role |
|---|---|
| `spur` | multi-call CLI (also symlinked to `sbatch`, `squeue`, `sinfo`, … by the playbook) |
| `spurctld` | controller / scheduler / Raft |
| `spurd` | node agent |
| `spurdbd` | accounting daemon (needs PostgreSQL) |

Stage them into one directory the control node can read:

```bash
mkdir -p /tmp/spur-bin
cp target/release/spur target/release/spurctld target/release/spurd target/release/spurdbd /tmp/spur-bin/
```

You point the playbook at this directory with `spur_binary_src` (see Step 4). If you omit `spur_binary_src`, the playbook falls back to the upstream `install.sh` — which only works once ROCm/spur publishes releases.

### 3. Install Ansible on the control node

The control node is wherever you run `ansible-playbook` — your workstation is fine; it does not need to be part of the cluster.

```bash
python3 -m pip install --user 'ansible-core>=2.14'
# WireGuard transport additionally needs the ansible.utils collection and the
# netaddr Python library on the control node:
ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yml
python3 -m pip install --user netaddr
```

Target hosts need: SSH reachable, sudo or root, `systemd`, and (for the `install.sh` fallback path only) `curl` + `tar`.

### 4. Write your inventory

Copy an example and edit it. Real inventories are git-ignored (see `.gitignore`) so host addresses and credentials are never committed — only the `*.example.ini` placeholder templates are tracked.

```bash
cd ansible
cp inventory/hosts.example.ini inventory/hosts.ini
$EDITOR inventory/hosts.ini
```

Point `spur_binary_src` at the directory from Step 2 (in `[all:vars]` or on the command line with `-e`).

### 5. Run the playbook

```bash
ansible-playbook playbooks/deploy.yml -i inventory/hosts.ini -e spur_binary_src=/tmp/spur-bin
```

The play ends by running a single-node test job (and, when ≥ 2 agents, a multi-node `-N` job) and — when accounting is enabled — recording them in PostgreSQL. Look for the `spur nodes` output and job stdout near the end of the run.

---

## Example commands per scenario

Each command assumes binaries are staged at `/tmp/spur-bin` (Step 2). Drop `-e spur_binary_src=…` once upstream publishes releases.

```bash
# Single-node (controller + agent on one host)
ansible-playbook playbooks/deploy.yml -i inventory/single.ini      -e spur_binary_src=/tmp/spur-bin

# Multi-node, direct LAN (1 controller + N agents)
ansible-playbook playbooks/deploy.yml -i inventory/multi.ini        -e spur_binary_src=/tmp/spur-bin

# HA, hyperconverged (3 controllers that also run agents)
ansible-playbook playbooks/deploy.yml -i inventory/ha.ini           -e spur_binary_src=/tmp/spur-bin

# HA, separate compute (3 dedicated controllers + distinct agent hosts)
ansible-playbook playbooks/deploy.yml -i inventory/ha-separate.ini  -e spur_binary_src=/tmp/spur-bin

# Any scenario WITHOUT accounting (no PostgreSQL/spurdbd; sacct unavailable, jobs still run)
ansible-playbook playbooks/deploy.yml -i inventory/multi.ini        -e spur_binary_src=/tmp/spur-bin -e spur_accounting_enabled=false

# WireGuard transport (encrypted mesh instead of LAN)
ansible-playbook playbooks/deploy.yml -i inventory/multi.ini        -e spur_binary_src=/tmp/spur-bin -e spur_transport=wireguard

# Preserve Raft state on re-deploy (production; don't wipe job history)
ansible-playbook playbooks/deploy.yml -i inventory/ha.ini           -e spur_binary_src=/tmp/spur-bin -e spur_wipe_state=false

# Limit to one host (e.g. re-push config to a single agent)
ansible-playbook playbooks/deploy.yml -i inventory/multi.ini        -e spur_binary_src=/tmp/spur-bin --limit gpu-1

# Dry-run the change set without applying
ansible-playbook playbooks/deploy.yml -i inventory/multi.ini        -e spur_binary_src=/tmp/spur-bin --check --diff
```

## Inventory examples

### Single-node

```ini
[spur_controllers]
node1 ansible_host=10.0.0.10 ansible_user=root

[spur_agents]
node1 ansible_host=10.0.0.10 ansible_user=root
```

### Multi-node, direct LAN

```ini
[spur_controllers]
ctl ansible_host=10.0.0.10 ansible_user=root

[spur_agents]
ctl   ansible_host=10.0.0.10 ansible_user=root   ; controller also runs an agent (hyperconverged)
gpu-1 ansible_host=10.0.0.11 ansible_user=root
gpu-2 ansible_host=10.0.0.12 ansible_user=root

[all:vars]
spur_transport=direct
```

### Multi-node, WireGuard mesh

```ini
[spur_controllers]
ctl ansible_host=ctl.example.com ansible_user=root

[spur_agents]
gpu-1 ansible_host=gpu1.example.com ansible_user=root
gpu-2 ansible_host=gpu2.example.com ansible_user=root

[all:vars]
spur_transport=wireguard
spur_wg_cidr=10.44.0.0/16
spur_wg_port=51820
```

> WireGuard is **single-controller only** — `spur net init` auto-assigns the controller `.1` and there is no multi-controller mesh command, so HA over WireGuard is not supported (use `direct` for HA). Agents are auto-assigned `.2`, `.3`, … by inventory position; override any host with `spur_wg_address=…`. Requires the `ansible.utils` collection on the control node (`ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yml`).

### HA — multi-controller Raft (hyperconverged)

```ini
[spur_controllers]
ctl-0 ansible_host=10.0.0.10 ansible_user=root
ctl-1 ansible_host=10.0.0.11 ansible_user=root
ctl-2 ansible_host=10.0.0.12 ansible_user=root   ; 3 → tolerates 1 failure

[spur_agents]
ctl-0 ansible_host=10.0.0.10 ansible_user=root   ; controllers also run agents
ctl-1 ansible_host=10.0.0.11 ansible_user=root
ctl-2 ansible_host=10.0.0.12 ansible_user=root
```

### HA — separate compute (control plane ≠ compute plane)

```ini
[spur_controllers]
ctl-0 ansible_host=10.0.0.10 ansible_user=root
ctl-1 ansible_host=10.0.0.11 ansible_user=root
ctl-2 ansible_host=10.0.0.12 ansible_user=root

[spur_agents]
gpu-1 ansible_host=10.0.0.21 ansible_user=root   ; dedicated compute — no spurctld here
gpu-2 ansible_host=10.0.0.22 ansible_user=root
```

What the playbook does in HA mode:

- Writes the same `peers = [...]` list to every controller's `spur.conf` (order matters — don't reorder controllers between deploys without wiping state).
- Assigns `node_id` = the controller's 1-based position in `groups['spur_controllers']`.
- Waits for a leader to be elected before proceeding to agent registration.
- Non-leader controllers forward client RPCs to the leader internally — clients can talk to any controller.

**Always use an odd `N` ≥ 3 in production.** Even N gives the same fault tolerance as `N-1` and is strictly worse. `N=2` has zero fault tolerance — only useful for exercising the HA code path.

**Client-side failover is NOT automatic** in Spur 0.3.0. `spurd --controller` accepts a single URL — the playbook points it at `groups['spur_controllers'][0]`. If that host dies, agents lose their connection even though Raft still has a leader on surviving controllers. Production HA needs an L4 VIP / DNS round-robin in front of `:6817` across all controllers, and setting `ansible_host` on the first controller (or overriding `spur_controller_addr`) to that VIP/DNS name.

A full HA inventory template lives at `inventory/hosts.ha.example.ini`.

---

## Accounting (PostgreSQL + spurdbd)

Enabled by default (`spur_accounting_enabled: true`). Accounting is one service for the whole cluster; it runs on **`spur_accounting_host`** (default: the first controller). Before the controllers start, it:

1. Installs `postgresql` + `postgresql-contrib`.
2. Creates the `spur` role and `spur` database idempotently.
3. Installs and starts the `spurdbd` systemd unit (`--migrate` creates the accounting tables).
4. Every controller's `spur.conf` gets an `[accounting]` block pointing at that host.

**Placing accounting on a dedicated node:** set `spur_accounting_host` to any managed host — a controller, an agent, or a standalone node listed in its own group (e.g. `[spur_accounting_node]`). Pass it via `-e` (a play's `hosts:` field does not reliably read inventory `[all:vars]`):

```bash
ansible-playbook playbooks/deploy.yml -i inventory/hosts.ini -e spur_accounting_host=acct-0
```

Then `sacct`/fairshare work. The playbook writes `SPUR_CONTROLLER_ADDR` and `SPUR_ACCOUNTING_ADDR` to `/etc/environment` on **controller nodes**, so the CLI (`squeue`/`sinfo`/`scontrol` and `sacct`/`sacctmgr`/`sreport`/`sshare`) works there with no per-command flags — including `sacct` from a controller that isn't the accounting host. On non-controller nodes (or to override), set the flag/env yourself: `sacct --accounting http://<accounting-host>:6819` or `export SPUR_ACCOUNTING_ADDR=...`. To skip the entire stack:

```bash
ansible-playbook playbooks/deploy.yml -i inventory/hosts.ini -e spur_accounting_enabled=false
```

Job submission still works without accounting — only `sacct`/fairshare are unavailable.

> The default DB credentials are `spur` / `spur` / `spur` — fine for a lab, **change `spur_accounting_db_password` for anything real.**

## Variables (defaults in `group_vars/all.yml`)

| Variable | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `spur_cluster_name` | `spur-cluster` | `cluster_name` in `spur.conf` |
| `spur_binary_src` | *(unset)* | Local dir of pre-built binaries to push. Unset → use upstream `install.sh`. |
| `spur_version` | `latest` | Install channel for `install.sh`: `latest` / `nightly` / `vX.Y.Z` |
| `spur_install_dir` | `/root/.local/bin` | Where binaries + Slurm symlinks land (added to `/etc/environment`) |
| `spur_home` | `/root/spur` | Per-host state/log/etc root |
| `spur_transport` | `direct` | `direct` or `wireguard` |
| `spur_accounting_enabled` | `true` | Deploy PostgreSQL + spurdbd. `false` to skip. |
| `spur_accounting_host` | first controller | Host that runs postgres + spurdbd (any managed host). Pass via `-e`. |
| `spur_accounting_db_name` / `_user` / `_password` | `spur` / `spur` / `spur` | Accounting DB credentials |
| `spur_accounting_port` | `6819` | spurdbd listen port |
| `spur_wg_cidr` / `spur_wg_port` / `spur_wg_interface` | `10.44.0.0/16` / `51820` / `spur0` | WireGuard mesh settings |
| `spur_controller_port` / `spur_agent_port` / `spur_raft_port` | `6817` / `6818` / `6821` | Listen ports |
| `spur_log_level` | `info` | Daemon log verbosity |
| `spur_wipe_state` | `false` | Wipe `~/spur/state` (Raft job queue/registrations) on (re)deploy. Default `false` so re-runs and upgrades are non-destructive; set `true` for a fresh install or an intentional Raft reinit. |

Override per-run with `-e key=value` (repeatable):

```bash
ansible-playbook playbooks/deploy.yml -i inventory/hosts.ini -e spur_binary_src=/tmp/spur-bin -e spur_wipe_state=true
```

---

## Upgrading

The playbook rolls out newer binaries idempotently. Re-running is non-destructive by default (`spur_wipe_state=false`) — job state and node registrations survive.

```bash
# rebuild all four so they share the same WAL/DB schema (see caveat below)
cargo build --release -p spur-cli -p spurctld -p spurd -p spurdbd
cp target/release/{spur,spurctld,spurd,spurdbd} /tmp/spur-bin/

# re-run — the binary copy is checksum-based, so only changed binaries are
# pushed; daemons restart to pick them up; Raft state is preserved
ansible-playbook playbooks/deploy.yml -i inventory/hosts.ini -e spur_binary_src=/tmp/spur-bin
```

- **Binaries are rolled out by content, not version string** — Ansible compares checksums, so a newer local build is pushed and a re-run with unchanged binaries is a near no-op.
- **Rebuild all four together.** The daemons share a Raft WAL schema and a spurdbd DB schema. Mixing binaries from different builds (e.g. rebuilding only `spurctld`) can leave a controller unable to parse a log written by a differently-versioned peer.
- **HA topology changes are guarded.** Because Spur 0.3.0 has no online Raft membership change, adding/removing/reordering a **controller** requires a Raft reinit. If you change the controller set with `spur_wipe_state=false`, the controller role fails early with an actionable message telling you to re-run with `-e spur_wipe_state=true`. **Compute agents are not Raft members** — add or remove them freely, no wipe needed.
- **Demoting a controller to agent-only leaves a stale `spurctld`.** If you move a host from `[spur_controllers]` to agent-only, stop and disable its controller first: `systemctl disable --now spurctld` on that host — otherwise the leftover daemon keeps the old membership and can block quorum.

---

## Managing the cluster after deploy

Daemons are systemd services, so use the normal tools on any host:

```bash
systemctl status spurctld          # on a controller
systemctl status spurd             # on an agent
systemctl status spurdbd postgresql  # on the first controller (accounting)
journalctl -u spurctld -f          # follow logs
```

Basic cluster commands (binaries are on `PATH` via `/etc/environment`):

```bash
spur nodes        # partition/node summary
spur queue        # job queue
spur submit job.sh
sacct             # accounting (when enabled) — Slurm-compatible symlink to spur
```

---

## Tear down

```bash
ansible-playbook playbooks/teardown.yml -i inventory/hosts.ini              # stop + disable daemons, remove units
ansible-playbook playbooks/teardown.yml -i inventory/hosts.ini -e wipe=true  # also rm -rf ~/spur
```

Teardown stops and disables the systemd services and reaps any stray daemons. It leaves PostgreSQL installed and the accounting database intact — to drop the DB, do it manually on the first controller (`sudo -u postgres dropdb spur; sudo -u postgres dropuser spur`).

---

## Hard-won gotchas baked into these roles

These are real bugs we hit during validation — listed so anyone reading the playbook understands why the roles look the way they do.

### Daemon / process management
- **Daemons run as systemd units**, not `nohup` — `/etc/systemd/system/spur{ctld,d,dbd}.service`, `enabled` (survive reboot), `Restart=on-failure`. The roles `daemon-reload` after templating a unit and use `state: restarted` so a redeploy always picks up new binaries/config.
- **`-D` is `--foreground`, not "daemonize"** (`crates/spurctld/src/main.rs`). The systemd units run the binary in the foreground under `Type=simple`, which is correct — do not add `-D`.
- **`pkill -f spurd` also kills `spurctld`** (substring match). Teardown uses `pkill -x` (exact name) only.
- **Stop-before-wipe ordering.** The controller role stops spurctld *before* wiping `~/spur/state`, so the daemon can't rewrite the Raft log mid-delete.

### Install
- **Upstream `install.sh` returns 403** because ROCm/spur has no published release yet. Use `spur_binary_src` to push locally-built binaries. The symlink + verify tasks run on both paths.
- **`spur --version` is not a supported flag** — it errors. The roles check for the binary with `stat`, not by running `--version`.
- **Slurm-compat symlinks** (`sbatch`/`squeue`/`sinfo`/`scancel`/`sacct`/`scontrol`/`salloc`/`srun` → `spur`) are created regardless of install source; the `spur` multi-call binary dispatches on argv[0].
- **A stale dpkg lock** during the accounting apt install means another apt/unattended-upgrade is running — wait for it (or clear a genuinely hung `apt-get`); don't `--force`.

### Accounting
- **Accounting is deployed before the controller** so spurdbd is listening when spurctld first reads its `[accounting]` block.
- **spurdbd needs `--migrate`** to create the accounting tables on first start.
- **With `spur_wipe_state=true`, the Raft job-id counter resets each deploy**, so re-deploys reuse job ids 1, 2, … which upsert onto the same accounting rows. Set `spur_wipe_state=false` to preserve job history.

### Spur quirks
- **Job stdout file lands in spurd's working directory at startup.** The `spurd` systemd unit sets `WorkingDirectory={{ spur_home }}` so output is predictably at `{{ spur_home }}/spur-<JOBID>.out`, even though `spur show job` reports the submitter's `WorkDir=`.
- **The single-node job's host is unpredictable.** The backfill scheduler picks any idle node, so `spur_verify` searches every agent rather than assuming the controller.
- **No shared-FS assumption in multi-node verify.** The play fetches `spur-<JOBID>.out` from each agent, not just the controller.
- **`spur nodes` collapses by partition** — the "NODES" column is a count, not one row per host. To confirm each expected host registered, loop `spur show node <name>`.
- **`spur show job` uses `JobState=COMPLETED` (uppercase)**, not `State: Completed`. The wait-loop greps `JobState=[A-Z]+`.
- **Harmless log spam `invalid transition from Completed to Completed`** on followers after a multi-node job (`crates/spurctld/src/cluster.rs`). The leader already reported terminal state; the follower's redundant report is rejected. The job succeeded.
- **Raft port 6821 is hardcoded** in spurctld and isn't a flag in 0.3.0. Preflight checks it alongside 6817/6818.

### Multi-node / HA specifics
- **Agent `--hostname` must match the `[[nodes]]` name in `spur.conf`.** The templates use `ansible_hostname` (short) on both sides.
- **HA needs a leader-elected wait**, not just a port-listening wait. `spurctld` binds `:6817` instantly but returns `Status::unavailable("no leader elected yet")` until quorum forms. The controller role loops on that message in `spur nodes` until it clears.
- **`peers` list order matters across controllers.** `node_id` is the 1-based position; openraft refuses to start if a node's `node_id` doesn't match its position. The role derives both from `groups['spur_controllers']` — don't reorder that group between deploys without wiping state.
- **`delegate_facts: true` evaluates `set_fact` on the controller, not the delegated target.** Use `hostvars[item].ansible_hostname` when setting a per-host fact via `delegate_to`.
- **`ansible.builtin.command` runs without a shell** — `command -v X` fails (bash builtin). Use `ansible.builtin.shell` with `executable: /bin/bash`.

If you hit a new gotcha, please add it here and (where applicable) encode the fix in the roles.

## Verified

`spur 0.3.0`, Ubuntu 22.04, validated across all four topologies on a 4-node cluster (fresh install — PostgreSQL purged beforehand), Ansible run from an operator workstation. Every scenario ran basic commands, drove a sample job to `COMPLETED`, confirmed all daemons `active` under systemd, and recorded jobs in PostgreSQL via `sacct`:

- **Single-node** — controller + agent on one host; job COMPLETED, accounted.
- **Multi-node** — 1 controller + 2 agents; `-N 2` job fanned across both nodes, accounted.
- **HA hyperconverged** — 3 controllers (Raft) + 3 agents; leader elected, `-N 3` job across all three, accounted.
- **HA + separate compute** — 3 dedicated controllers (no agent) + 1 dedicated agent; leader elected, controllers ran no `spurd`, job ran on the separate compute node, accounted.
- **Accounting disabled** (`-e spur_accounting_enabled=false`) — PostgreSQL/spurdbd skipped, job still COMPLETED.

WireGuard transport is supported via `roles/spur_wireguard`. Enable it with `-e spur_transport=wireguard`. It is **single-controller only** (`spur net init` auto-assigns the controller `.1`; there is no multi-controller mesh command), so HA runs over `direct`. Agents auto-assign `.2`, `.3`, … Requires the `ansible.utils` collection (`ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yml`).
